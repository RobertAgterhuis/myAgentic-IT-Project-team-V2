# Recommendations Output Contract
> Version: 1.0 | Applies to all recommendations deliverables of all agents

---

## PURPOSE
This contract defines the mandatory structure and quality requirements for the **Recommendations** deliverable.
Every recommendation must be substantiated, measurable, and dependency-aware.

---

## Output File Path

`.github/docs/phases/phase-N-[discipline]-recommendations.md`

Where `N` is the phase number (1–4) and `[discipline]` is the lowercase discipline name (e.g., `phase-2-tech-recommendations.md`).

---

## MANDATORY SCHEMA

### MARKDOWN STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Recommendations – [Discipline] – [Date]

## Metadata
- Agent: [name]
- Phase: [1 / 2 / 3 / 4]
- Based on analysis: [reference to analysis document]
- Date: [ISO 8601]
- Mode: [CREATE | AUDIT]

## Scope Change Impact — Recommendations *(SCOPE_CHANGE mode only — omit in normal cycles)*
> Required as the FIRST section (directly after Metadata) when `cycle_type: SCOPE_CHANGE` in session state. Used by Synthesis Agent (17) for SC-[N] impact summaries in department reports.

| Status | Recommendation ID | Reason |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Still Applicable | REC-NNN | [one-line reason why still relevant under new premise] |
| Superseded | REC-NNN | [what changed that makes this recommendation no longer applicable] |
| Net-New | REC-NNN | [short description of recommendation with no equivalent in prior analysis] |

## Recommendation [REC-NNN]

### Problem
[Concrete description of the problem or design challenge – reference finding ID from analysis]
**Analysis reference:** [GAP-NNN / RISK-NNN / CS-NNN]

### Solution
[Concrete, specific solution – not generic]
**Implementation approach:**
1. Step 1: [what, how, by whom, when]
2. Step 2: [...]

### Impact
| Dimension | Expected effect | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Revenue | [amount / % / INSUFFICIENT_DATA:] | [substantiation or data source] |
| Risk Reduction | [description + level] | [substantiation] |
| Cost | [amount / % / INSUFFICIENT_DATA:] | [substantiation] |
| UX | [description] | [substantiation] |

### Rationale
[Theoretical framework, proven approach, or data that substantiates the choice]

### Dependencies
- Requires: [other recommendation / technical requirement / external factor]
- Blocked by: [if applicable]
- Depends on output of: [agent name if applicable]

### Risk of Not Implementing
[What are the consequences if this recommendation is NOT implemented]

### Measurement Criterion
- KPI: [specific KPI]
- Baseline: [current value or INSUFFICIENT_DATA:]
- Target: [intended value]
- Measurement method: [how measured]
- Time horizon: [when to measure]

---

## PRIORITY MATRIX (MANDATORY)

| Recommendation ID | Impact | Effort | Priority | Sprint |
|----------------|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| REC-001 | High | Low | P1 | Sprint 1 |
| REC-002 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] |

Impact and Effort: High / Medium / Low (with explicit rationale in appendix)

### Priority-to-Severity Mapping

| Priority | Standard Severity |
|----------|-------------------|
| `P1` | `Critical` or `High` |
| `P2` | `Medium` |
| `P3` | `Low` |

## HANDOFF CHECKLIST
- [ ] All recommendations reference an analysis finding (GAP/RISK/CS/DESIGN ID)
- [ ] All impacts have rationale (no empty cells)
- [ ] All INSUFFICIENT_DATA: items are documented
- [ ] Measurement criteria are SMART formulated
- [ ] Priority matrix is fully completed
- [ ] Dependencies are documented
- [ ] No recommendations outside competence domain
- [ ] All INSUFFICIENT_DATA: items tagged with QUESTIONNAIRE_REQUEST in handoff message
- [ ] If cycle_type is SCOPE_CHANGE: Scope Change Impact — Recommendations section present as FIRST section (Still Applicable / Superseded / Net-New) (or `NOT_APPLICABLE` — normal cycle)
- [ ] JSON export is valid and complete
```

## VALIDATION CRITERIA
A recommendations document is REJECTED if:
- A recommendation has no reference to an analysis finding
- Impact fields are empty without `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:` marking
- Measurement criteria are missing or not SMART
- The priority matrix is missing
- A recommendation falls outside the competence domain

### Cross-reference: ORC-35
**ORC-35**: If this contract's output fails validation 3 consecutive times in the same session, the Orchestrator escalates to the user with options: ACCEPT_PARTIAL, RETRY_SIMPLIFIED, or MANUAL_OVERRIDE.
