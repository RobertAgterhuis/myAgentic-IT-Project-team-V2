# Security Guardrails – Security Architect
> Applies to: Security Architect (Phase 2) and as a cross-cutting concern for all other agents

---

## DOMAIN: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### G-SEC-01 – Zero Trust Principle
**Rule:** Every architecture recommendation that implicitly assumes trust (e.g. "internal traffic is safe") is blocked and reported as a security gap.  
**Verification:** Explicitly check for the presence of: network segmentation, identity-based access, least privilege, mutual TLS.

### G-SEC-02 – Secrets Never in Code
**Rule:** Every identified secret (API key, password, token, connection string) in code, config files, or version control is immediately marked as `CRITICAL_FINDING`.  
**Action:** Document location (file + line number), escalate to Orchestrator, and include in sprint plan sprint 1.

### G-SEC-03 – Automated Security Scans in CI Mandatory
**Rule:** CI/CD recommendations MUST always include security scanning: SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container scanning.  
**Current state:** If no security scans are present in CI, this is reported as a `CRITICAL_GAP`.

### G-SEC-04 – OWASP Top 10 Verification
**Rule:** Security Architect ALWAYS performs an explicit check on each of the OWASP Top 10 categories.  
**Format:** Per OWASP category: status (Present / Absent / Not Verifiable) + finding + source reference.  
**Prohibition:** No "not applicable" without a demonstrable reason.

### G-SEC-05 – IAM Analysis Mandatory
**Rule:** Identity & Access Management is always analyzed for: over-privileging, orphaned accounts, shared credentials, MFA presence.

### G-SEC-06 – Compliance Framework Established
**Rule:** Before security recommendations are made, the applicable compliance framework MUST be established (GDPR, ISO27001, SOC2, NIS2, HIPAA, etc.).  
**Prohibition:** No compliance statements without an established framework.

### G-SEC-07 – Vulnerability Scoring
**Rule:** Every security finding is scored with CVSS v3.1 (or equivalent) if a CVE is available, or as Low/Medium/High/Critical with explicit rationale if no CVE is available.

### G-SEC-08 – Penetration Test Gap
**Rule:** If no recent penetration test is available (< 12 months), this is reported as a `HIGH_PRIORITY_GAP`.

## CROSS-CUTTING: SECURITY AS RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL AGENTS
Every agent (not just the Security Architect) is required to mark security-relevant findings as `SECURITY_FLAG: [description]` and forward them to the Security Architect's input queue.

### Security Finding Schema
Each security finding object MUST contain: `{ id, title, severity, owasp_category, source, description, recommendation, status }`.
