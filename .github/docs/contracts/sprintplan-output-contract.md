# Sprint Plan Output Contract
> Version: 1.2 | Applies to all sprint plan deliverables of all agents

---

## PURPOSE
This contract defines the mandatory structure for the **Sprint Plan** deliverable per agent.
A sprint plan without capacity assumption, team assignment, story type classification, dependencies, parallel tracks, blocker register, or measurable outcomes is NOT valid.

---

## Output File Path

`.github/docs/phases/phase-N-[discipline]-sprintplan.md`

Where `N` is the phase number (1–4) and `[discipline]` is the lowercase discipline name (e.g., `phase-3-ux-sprintplan.md`).

---

## FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE: TRACK INDEPENDENCE

**CRITICAL RULE:** A blocker in a CONTENT-, DESIGN-, or ANALYSIS-story may NEVER block a CODE-story in the same sprint, and vice versa.

Every story has a `story_type`. This type determines which **execution pipeline** the story runs through:

| Story Type | Description | Execution Pipeline |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `CODE` | Modify or add production code | Implementation Agent → Test Agent → PR/Review Agent |
| `INFRA` | Infrastructure, CI/CD, configuration | Implementation Agent → Test Agent → PR/Review Agent |
| `DESIGN` | Design, wireframes, prototypes, style guides | Manual or design tooling |
| `CONTENT` | Copy, campaigns, marketing materials, texts | Manual or content tooling |
| `ANALYSIS` | Research, data analysis, reporting, strategy documents | Manual |

**Blockers are track-bound:**
- An EXTERN blocker on story type `CONTENT` (e.g. waiting for client approval of campaign text) **never blocks** a `CODE` story in the same sprint.
- Parallel tracks are ALWAYS grouped per story type, so the code team is never dependent on the progress of non-technical tracks.
- The Orchestrator routes automatically based on `story_type`. CODE and INFRA stories go to the autonomous implementation pipeline. Other types follow their own throughput time.

---

## MANDATORY ASSUMPTIONS BEFORE SPRINT PLAN

Before a sprint plan is created, the following assumptions MUST be documented EXPLICITLY:

```markdown
## Sprint Plan Assumptions
- Team composition: [per team: name, roles, number of people]
  - Team A – [name]: [roles] – [n people] – capacity: [SP or hours/sprint]
  - Team B – [name]: [roles] – [n people] – capacity: [SP or hours/sprint]
  (add teams based on available data, or mark as INSUFFICIENT_DATA:)
- Sprint duration: [n weeks]
- Technology stack: [relevant for the sprint]
- Prerequisites: [what must be in place before sprint 1 starts]
```

If these assumptions are NOT available: mark as `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:` and do NOT create a fictional sprint plan.

---

## MANDATORY SCHEMA

### MARKDOWN STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Sprint Plan – [Discipline] – [Date]

## Metadata
- Agent: [name]
- Phase: [1 / 2 / 3 / 4]
- Based on recommendations: [reference document]
- Date: [ISO 8601]
- Total scope: [n sprints]
- Mode: [CREATE | AUDIT]

## Assumptions
[See mandatory assumptions above]

## Sprint [N] – [Sprint name]

### Goal
[What is the outcome of this sprint – not the output, but the result for the business/user]

### Stories

| Story ID | Description | Type | Team | Acceptance Criteria | Story Points | Dependencies | Blocker | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| SP-N-001 | [concrete task] | CODE | [Team A] | [SMART, testable] | [number] | [story ID or external] | [NONE / INTERN: description / EXTERN: description + owner] | [optional] |

> **Type**: required. Choose from: `CODE`, `INFRA`, `DESIGN`, `CONTENT`, `ANALYSIS`. Determines the execution pipeline.  
> **Team**: required per story. Use team names from assumptions, or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:`.  
> **Blocker**: use `NONE` if there is no blocker. Intern = resolvable within the project. Extern = outside project control (vendor, client, legislation). Always mention owner + escalation route for EXTERN.  
> **TRACK INDEPENDENCE:** A blocker from a CONTENT/DESIGN/ANALYSIS story may NEVER appear as a blocker on a CODE/INFRA story.

### Parallel Tracks
Explicitly identify which stories can be executed **in parallel** (no mutual dependency). Group first by story type, then by team:

| Track | Type | Stories | Team(s) | Start condition |
|-------|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Track 1 (Code) | CODE | SP-N-001, SP-N-002 | Team Dev | Sprint N start |
| Track 2 (Design) | DESIGN | SP-N-003 | Team UX | Sprint N start |
| Track 3 (Content) | CONTENT | SP-N-004 | Team Marketing | Sprint N start |

> **PROHIBITION:** Do not claim a parallel track if a hidden dependency exists. Document doubt as `UNCERTAIN:`.  
> **RULE:** CODE/INFRA tracks and DESIGN/CONTENT/ANALYSIS tracks are by definition independent of each other's blockers. Document this explicitly.

### Blocker Register (Sprint N)
All blockers from stories in this sprint consolidated:

| Blocker ID | Type | Description | Owner | Expected Resolution | Escalation if not resolved by |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| BLK-N-001 | INTERN / EXTERN | [description] | [name/role] | [date or sprint] | [escalation route] |

### Sprint KPIs
| KPI | Baseline | Target after sprint | Measurement method |
|-----|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| [name] | [value] | [value] | [method] |

### Definition of Done (Sprint N)
- [ ] All stories complete (acceptance criteria met)
- [ ] Code review performed
- [ ] Tests passed
- [ ] KPI measurement performed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No new CRITICAL_FINDING introduced

## Dependency Overview
Tabular or visual overview of story dependencies across sprints:

| Story | Depends on | Type | Blocking? |
|-------|----------------|------|------------|
| SP-2-001 | SP-1-003 | Internal story | Yes |
| SP-2-002 | External API delivery | EXTERN | Yes – BLK-2-001 |

## Parallel Tracks Overview
Overview of all parallel workflows across all sprints:

| Sprint | Track | Stories | Teams |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | Track 1 | SP-1-001, SP-1-002 | Team A |
| Sprint 1 | Track 2 | SP-1-003 | Team B |

## Sprint Plan Risk Log
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Sprint |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|--------|

## Consolidated Blocker Register
All blockers across all sprints:

| Blocker ID | Sprint | Type | Description | Owner | Escalation if not resolved by |
|------------|--------|------|-------------|---------|----------------------------------|

## VALIDATION CRITERIA
A sprint plan is REJECTED if:
- Capacity assumptions per team are missing (not marked as INSUFFICIENT_DATA:)
- Stories have no team assignment
- Stories have no story type classification (CODE/INFRA/DESIGN/CONTENT/ANALYSIS)
- A CODE/INFRA story has a blocker originating from a DESIGN/CONTENT/ANALYSIS story
- Stories have no acceptance criteria
- Story points are missing without marking
- Sprint KPIs are not SMART
- Dependencies are not documented
- Blocker field is missing on a story (even NONE must be explicitly stated)
- EXTERN blockers have no owner or escalation route
- Parallel tracks are not identified (or absent without motivation)

### Cross-reference: ORC-35
**ORC-35**: If this contract's output fails validation 3 consecutive times in the same session, the Orchestrator escalates to the user with options: ACCEPT_PARTIAL, RETRY_SIMPLIFIED, or MANUAL_OVERRIDE.
