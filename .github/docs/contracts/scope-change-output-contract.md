# Scope Change Agent Output Contract
> Version: 1.0 | Defines the mandatory output structure for the Scope Change Agent (Agent 37)

---

## PURPOSE
Ensures that fundamental project premise changes (business model pivots, core architecture changes, target audience shifts) are processed through a structured scope change protocol. The Scope Change Agent produces a delta report, places affected tickets on backlog hold, and prepares Sprint Gate reconciliation data to update the Master Synthesis.
