# myAgentic-IT-Project-team – End-to-End Software Solution Creation & Audit

A **multi-agent system** for creating complete, production-ready software solutions — or auditing existing ones. The team consists of 38 specialized AI agents that work together sequentially, each with a fixed role, dedicated skill file, and output contract.

> **Key figures:** a complete Phase 1–4 cycle that takes 7–10 weeks manually costs only **5–10 working days** in calendar time with this agentic team — with just **7–12 hours of active attention** from you spread across that period. The bottleneck is your review speed, not the AI. Phase 5 sprints take **2–5 working days** per sprint instead of 1–2 weeks.

---

## Quickstart – in 3 steps

**1. Make sure you meet the requirements** (see [Requirements](#requirements)):

- GitHub account + active GitHub Copilot subscription
- VS Code open in this project's workspace
- A project brief or product idea (CREATE mode), or a codebase to be analyzed (AUDIT mode)

**2. Start with a single command** in the Copilot Chat in VS Code:

```text
CREATE MyProject
```

Replace `MyProject` with the name of your software. The Onboarding Agent will ask you a series of intake questions. Answer them as completely as possible — the quality of the entire output depends on it.

> Already have an existing codebase to analyze? Use `AUDIT MyProject` instead. See [Which command should I use?](#which-command-should-i-use) for all options.

**3. Track progress** via the generated files in `.github/docs/` and the GitHub Kanban project that is automatically created.

Want a partial or targeted run? See [Which command should I use?](#which-command-should-i-use) for the available options.

## What does this system do?

The system supports two primary modes:

- **CREATE mode** — Design and build a complete new software solution from scratch, from business strategy to implementation.
- **AUDIT mode** — Perform a comprehensive analysis of an existing software product, producing findings, recommendations, and an improvement roadmap.

Both modes follow the same five-phase structure. After the analysis/design phases, an autonomous sprint-by-sprint implementation follows.

| Phase | CREATE mode | AUDIT mode | Agents | Manual | With agents |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **1 – Requirements & Strategy** | Business model design, product vision, requirements definition | Market position analysis, revenue model audit, gap identification | Business Analyst, Domain Expert, Sales Strategist, Financial Analyst, Product Manager | 1–2 weeks | **1–3 days** |
| **2 – Architecture & Design** | System design, technology stack selection, security planning | Codebase analysis, architecture assessment, tech debt scoring | Software Architect, Senior Developer, DevOps Engineer, Security Architect, Data Architect, Legal Counsel | 2–3 weeks | **2–4 days** |
| **3 – Experience Design** | UX/UI design, accessibility baseline, content & localization plan | User research analysis, design system assessment, content audit | UX Researcher, UX Designer, UI Designer, Accessibility Specialist, Content Strategist, Localization Specialist | 2–3 weeks | **2–4 days** |
| **4 – Brand, Marketing & Growth** | Brand identity, growth strategy, conversion funnel design | Brand consistency analysis, funnel optimization, SEO assessment | Brand Strategist, Growth Marketer, CRO Specialist | 2 weeks | **1–2 days** |
| **5 – Implementation (per sprint)** | Sprint-by-sprint realization of the solution | Sprint-by-sprint realization of the improvement roadmap | Implementation, Test, PR/Review, KPI, Documentation, GitHub Integration, Retrospective | 1–2 weeks/sprint | **2–5 days/sprint** |

Each phase delivers four fixed deliverables: **Analysis → Recommendations → Sprint Plan → Guardrails**.  
After all phases, the Synthesis Agent produces **six documents** in `.github/docs/synthesis/`:

| File | Content | Audience |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `final-report-master.md` | Executive Summary, Solution Blueprint Heatmap (CREATE) or Capability Heatmap (AUDIT), Risk Matrix, 12-month Roadmap, KPIs | Board, management |
| `final-report-business.md` | Findings, recommendations, roadmap items, KPIs and blockers for Business | Business, Sales, Finance |
| `final-report-tech.md` | Same for Technology & Architecture | Engineering, DevOps, Security |
| `final-report-ux.md` | Same for UX & Product | UX/UI, Product owners |
| `final-report-marketing.md` | Same for Brand & Marketing | Marketing, Growth, CRO |
| `cross-team-blocker-matrix.md` | All cross-team dependencies (BLOCKING / ADVISORY) | All teams + Orchestrator |

Each department report is fully self-contained and includes a mandatory **"Blockers from other teams"** section, so every department can act directly without having to read the full master report.

### Generated business documents

Parallel to the analysis output, the system generates and maintains living business documents in `BusinessDocs/`:

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `BusinessDocs/Phase1-Business/Questionnaires/` | Questions generated from Phase 1 gaps — fill in to improve the next analysis |
| `BusinessDocs/Phase2-Tech/Questionnaires/` | Same for Technology & Architecture |
| `BusinessDocs/Phase3-UX/Questionnaires/` | Same for UX & Product |
| `BusinessDocs/Phase4-Marketing/Questionnaires/` | Same for Brand & Marketing |
| `BusinessDocs/OfficialDocuments/` | 8 living business documents updated after every CREATE, AUDIT, or REEVALUATE cycle: `product-vision.md`, `technical-overview.md`, `brand-brief.md`, `market-positioning.md`, `ux-design-brief.md`, `legal-compliance-overview.md`, `content-strategy-brief.md`, `financial-model-overview.md` |
| `BusinessDocs/questionnaire-index.md` | Overview of all questionnaire files with answer status |

> **How do questionnaires work?** When an agent cannot find information in the provided input or documentation, it marks it as `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:`. After each phase, the Questionnaire Agent converts these gaps into a client-friendly questionnaire. You fill in the answers, then run `REEVALUATE` or a new cycle — the system automatically picks up your answers and produces a more comprehensive analysis.

> **What do you do with the reports?**  
> The department reports are directly usable as input for departmental meetings. The master report contains the 12-month roadmap that is automatically converted into GitHub Issues for Phase 5. You don't need to prioritize yourself — the Synthesis Agent, Critic Agent, and Risk Agent have already done that.

## Requirements

### Required

| Requirement | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| **GitHub account** | With access to the target repository. The GitHub Integration Agent creates a Kanban project and publishes all stories as Issues. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Agent functionality requires an active Copilot subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise). |
| **VS Code** | The agents run as Copilot Agents in the VS Code editor. |
| **Git** | Local Git installation for repository management and (in AUDIT mode) codebase history analysis by the Onboarding Agent. |
| **Project input** | CREATE mode: a project brief or product idea. AUDIT mode: the codebase to be analyzed, locally available or cloned. Without input, the Onboarding Agent cannot start. |

### Optional

| Requirement | What for | Without this... |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Canva Connect API token** | Brand & Assets Agent (Agent 30) automatically creates a brand kit, generates assets, and exports design tokens via the Canva API. | Skipped (`SKIPPED_NO_TOKEN`); the Storybook Agent derives tokens from the Brand Strategist output. |
| **Node.js ≥ 18** | Storybook Agent (Agent 31) installs and starts a local Storybook environment. | Storybook step fails; mark as `TOOLING_GAP` in the Onboarding Output — Phases 1–4 are not blocked. |
| **TruffleHog** | PR/Review Agent uses TruffleHog for secret scanning as a merge gate. | Secret scan step is skipped; PR/Review Agent reports `TOOL_UNAVAILABLE: TruffleHog` and escalates. |
| **Stakeholder documentation** | Business requirements, user research, brand guidelines — enhances the quality of all phase outputs. | Agents mark missing items as `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:` and continue with what is available. |

> **Canva API:** The Canva Connect API for brand kit functionality is currently invite-only. Request access at [developer.canva.com](https://developer.canva.com). This is entirely optional — the system works without it.

## Which command should I use?

Use this as a decision guide:

### CREATE commands (new software)

| Situation | Command |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Build a complete new software solution | `CREATE [project]` |
| Design only the business strategy | `CREATE BUSINESS [project]` |
| Design only the technical architecture | `CREATE TECH [project]` |
| Design UX and marketing in one session | `CREATE UX MARKETING [project]` |
| Merge previously completed partial designs | `CREATE SYNTHESIS` |

### AUDIT commands (existing software)

| Situation | Command |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Complete analysis of existing software | `AUDIT [project]` |
| Assess the technical state only | `AUDIT TECH [project]` |
| UX and marketing assessment in one session | `AUDIT UX MARKETING [project]` |
| Merge a previously started partial audit | `AUDIT SYNTHESIS` |

### On-demand commands (both modes)

| Situation | Command |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Add new functionality to an existing project | `FEATURE [name]: [description]` |
| A module has changed significantly, reassessment needed | `REEVALUATE [scope]` |
| The fundamental premise changed (business pivot, architecture change, new target audience) | `SCOPE CHANGE [DIMENSION]: [description]` |
| Critical production issue, immediate fix required | `HOTFIX [description]` |
| Context significantly changed after 5+ sprints | `REFRESH ONBOARDING` |

> **Partial cycles:** Both CREATE and AUDIT support running 1, 2, or 3 disciplines independently — e.g. `CREATE TECH UX MyProject`. Disciplines are always executed in canonical order (BUSINESS → TECH → UX → MARKETING). Produces the department reports for the chosen disciplines.
> **Combining partial cycles:** If you previously ran `CREATE BUSINESS` and `CREATE TECH` on the same project, run `CREATE SYNTHESIS` to produce a combined report and the Cross-Team Blocker Matrix (once all 4 phases are present).
> **For a full guide on CREATE vs AUDIT mode**, see [.github/docs/mode-guide.md](mode-guide.md).

## How do you use this system?

### Step 1 — Start a project

Type the desired command in the Copilot Chat in VS Code. The Onboarding Agent starts automatically and asks intake questions about:

- **CREATE mode:** Product idea, target audience, value proposition, business model, budget, timeline
- **AUDIT mode:** Target audience and market, technical stack and infrastructure, available data
- **Both modes:** GitHub project name (for automatically creating the Kanban board), Canva API token (optional, for brand assets)

Answers are saved in `.github/docs/session/session-state.json`. The Orchestrator uses this state throughout the entire cycle.

> Make sure to answer the intake questions completely — the quality of the entire output depends on the onboarding input. The more context you provide, the more concrete the results.

---

### Step 2 — Follow the phase sequence

The Orchestrator directs each agent in the mandatory sequence. You don't need to route anything yourself. Each agent:

- Reads the output of the previous phase as mandatory input
- Produces its deliverables as Markdown + JSON files in `.github/docs/phase-[N]/`
- Closes with a **Handoff Checklist** — the next agent only starts once everything is checked off

After each phase, the **Critic Agent** and **Risk Agent** validate the output. When uncertain about findings you will see:

- `UNCERTAIN: [claim]` — agent is not certain, requests confirmation
- `INSUFFICIENT_DATA: [field]` — required data is missing, agent continues with what is available

Both are escalated to you via `.github/docs/decisions.md` or the Copilot Chat before the next phase starts.

---

### Step 3 — Sprint implementation (Phase 5)

After approval of the final report, the **GitHub Integration Agent** publishes all stories as Issues in your GitHub project. Then Phase 5 starts:

```text
Sprint Gate (Definition of Ready + lessons-learned injection)
  → Implementation Agent → Test Agent → PR/Review Agent (secret scan)
  → KPI Agent → Documentation Agent → GitHub Integration Agent → Retrospective Agent
  → Critic + Risk validation per sprint
  → Next sprint
```

Each sprint ends with a retrospective and KPI measurement. Lessons learned are automatically carried forward to the next sprint via the Sprint Gate. All sprint artifacts can be found in `.github/docs/retrospectives/`.

---

### At any time — Feature or reassessment

```text
FEATURE [name]: [description]
```

Starts an isolated full cycle (Phases 1–5) for a single new feature. Output goes to `Workitems/[FEATURENAME]/`, completely separate from the main backlog.

```text
REEVALUATE [scope]
```

Reassesses a previously completed component after a change (e.g. `REEVALUATE TECH` after a major design revision or refactor). Generates a Re-evaluation Report and injects impacts into the ongoing Sprint Gate.

```text
SCOPE CHANGE [DIMENSION]: [description]
```

Use when the **fundamental premise** of the project has changed — e.g. a business model pivot, a core architecture switch, a new target audience selection. `DIMENSION` is one of `BUSINESS | TECH | UX | MARKETING | ALL`. The Scope Change Agent puts the affected backlog stories on hold, marks prior analysis of that dimension as `INVALIDATED`, re-runs the analysis for that dimension, and updates the Master Synthesis. Output: `.github/docs/synthesis/scope-change-[N].md`. This is distinct from `REEVALUATE`, which handles incremental changes, not directional shifts.

> **Which files can I edit myself?**  
> `.github/docs/decisions.md` is your direct communication channel — you fill this in. All other files in `.github/docs/` are generated and overwritten by agents. Do not edit them manually, or the agents will go out of sync.

---

## Decisions & Open Questions (`.github/docs/decisions.md`)

This is your direct communication channel with the agentic team. Fill it in yourself; agents adapt their behavior automatically.

| Status | What the Orchestrator does |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `OPEN` + priority `HIGH` + sprint touches scope | **Sprint Gate blocks** until you respond in the file |
| `OPEN` + priority `MEDIUM/LOW` | Notification at Sprint Gate, no blocking |
| `DECIDED` | Injected as a hard constraint into all relevant agents |
| `DEFERRED` / `EXPIRED` | Ignored |

Each decision or question gets a unique ID (`DEC-NNN`), a scope (e.g. `Phase 2`, `SP-3`, `All sprints`), and a priority.

---

## Ground rules

| Rule | What it means |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| **Anti-hallucination** | Agents never fabricate facts. Uncertain claims get the prefix `UNCERTAIN:` |
| **Source citation required** | Every finding references a file, line number, or document |
| **Phase order is mandatory** | An agent may never start without the output of the previous phase as input |
| **Handoff Checklist** | Every agent verifies its own output completely before handoff — no partials |
| **Immutable sprint files** | `sprint-[SP-N]-*.md` and `sprint-[SP-N]-*.json` are never overwritten after creation |
| **Secret scan as merge gate** | PR/Review Agent blocks the merge if secrets are found (TruffleHog) |
| **Storybook as design system** | Implementation Agent only uses components from `.github/docs/storybook/component-inventory.md`. New components require a Storybook story + a11y check first |
| **decisions.md is authoritative** | Decisions in `.github/docs/decisions.md` always override agent assumptions; HIGH-priority open questions block sprint start |

---

## Contracts and guardrails — what are those?

**Contracts** (`.github/docs/contracts/`) define what each agent is required to produce. If an agent does not fully fulfill its contract, the Critic Agent sends it back. As a user you don't need to read the contracts, but they explain why an agent sometimes returns "BLOCKED".

**Guardrails** (`.github/docs/guardrails/00–09`) are testable, binding decision rules per domain. They prevent agents from repeating the same category of errors across sprints. When a violation occurs you will see `GUARDRAIL_VIOLATION: G-XXX-NNN` in the output, with a mandatory remediation action.

---

## Frequently asked questions & troubleshooting

**An agent returns HALT — what do I do?**  
The agent is missing required input. Check `.github/docs/decisions.md` for open questions with priority HIGH, or review the Handoff Checklist of the previous agent for missing sections. Resolve the blocking item and restart the agent via the Orchestrator.

**I see many `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:` messages — is that a problem?**  
No. It means the agent did not have enough data for that specific finding, but continued with what was available. If you supply the missing data later (e.g. analytics data, usability test results), you can run `REEVALUATE [scope]`.

**An agent produces generic recommendations without source references — what now?**  
This is a contract violation. The Critic Agent should catch this. If it slips through: report the finding as `ANTI_LAZINESS_VIOLATION` in `.github/docs/decisions.md` and restart the relevant agent.

**The session-state.json is corrupt or missing — what do I do?**  
Run `REFRESH ONBOARDING`. The Onboarding Agent re-runs steps 3 and 4 (codebase scan + tooling) without asking new intake questions. The intake answers remain intact.

**Can I roll back a previous sprint?**  
Sprint files are immutable. You can run a `HOTFIX` to fix a bug, or manually move a story back in GitHub and wait for the next Sprint Gate. The Retrospective Agent documents this as a LESSON_CANDIDATE.

**The GitHub Integration Agent cannot create a project — what is wrong?**  
Check that `GITHUB_PROJECT_NAME` is filled in `.github/docs/session/session-state.json` and that your GitHub token has write access to the repository. See the Human Escalation in your Copilot Chat for the exact error message.

**How long does a full cycle take?**  

| | Manual | With this agentic team |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Phase 1–4 (analysis/design) | 7–10 weeks | **5–10 working days** |
| Phase 5 (per sprint) | 1–2 weeks | **2–5 working days** |
| Your active attention (Phase 1–4) | Weeks full-time | **7–12 hours total** |

The bottleneck is not AI processing time, but your review speed between phases. If you are available quickly for `UNCERTAIN:` escalations, you can easily reach the lower end of 5 days. There are three moments when you need to be actively involved: (1) the onboarding intake (~1 hour), (2) answering escalations (~2–4 hours spread across phases), and (3) reviewing the final reports (~3–5 hours). The agents continue working autonomously in the meantime.

For CREATE mode, the timeline is comparable — the design and strategy phases take similar effort to analysis phases. For AUDIT mode with a large monorepo (~500k+ lines), expect the upper end of the above ranges.
