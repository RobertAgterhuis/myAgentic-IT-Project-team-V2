A **multi-agent system** of 38 specialized AI agents that creates complete, production-ready software solutions — or audits existing ones — through a structured four-phase analysis followed by autonomous sprint-by-sprint implementation.

> **Quick result:** A full Phase 1–4 cycle that takes 7–10 weeks manually completes in **5–10 working days** with this agentic team, requiring only **7–12 hours of active attention** from you.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **GitHub account** | With repository access (the system creates a Kanban project automatically) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Active subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise) |
| **VS Code** | Agents run as Copilot Agents in the VS Code editor |
| **Git** | Local installation for repository management |
| **Node.js ≥ 18** | For the Command Center web UI and MCP server |

---

## Quick Start

**1. Open this workspace in VS Code** with Copilot enabled.

**2. (Recommended) Launch the Command Center web UI:**

```bash
node .github/webapp/server.js
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) in your browser.

**3. Start a project** — in the Command Center:
- Select **CREATE** (or **AUDIT** for existing software)
- Enter a project name
- Optionally paste your full requirements in the **Project Brief** field (saved as a file, not sent to chat)
- Click **Queue Command** and paste the short command into Copilot Chat

Alternatively, type directly in Copilot Chat:
```text
CREATE MyProject
```

**4. Follow the agent pipeline:**
- The Orchestrator runs **one agent at a time** — type **CONTINUE** after each
- At **phase boundaries**, start a **new Copilot Chat** and type **CONTINUE** (all progress is preserved)
- Critic + Risk Agents validate every phase and every sprint automatically
- Track progress in the Command Center pipeline view

**5. Answer questionnaires & decisions** — when agents need your input, questions appear in the **Questionnaires** tab. Use the **Decisions** tab to create decisions or answer open questions. Answer them, then run `REEVALUATE` for improved results.

## MCP Server (Cross-IDE Integration)

The system includes an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that exposes the Command Center functionality to any MCP-compatible IDE — VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, and others.

### Setup

**VS Code** — The `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration is included. The MCP server appears automatically in the Copilot tools panel.

**Other IDEs** — Configure an MCP stdio server with:
```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": [".github/webapp/mcp-server.js"]
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_project_status` | Session state, pipeline progress, and command queue summary |
| `get_progress` | Detailed phase completion and current agent info |
| `list_questionnaires` | All questionnaires with completion statistics |
| `get_questionnaire` | Full contents of a specific questionnaire |
| `save_answers` | Save answers to questionnaire questions |
| `list_decisions` | All decisions grouped by status |
| `create_decision` | Create a new open question or operational decision |

| `get_audit_log` | Recent mutation audit trail entries |

### MCP Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `agentic://session-state` | Current session state as JSON |
| `agentic://decisions` | All decisions as JSON |

## Key Concepts

- **Phases 1–4** produce Analysis → Recommendations → Sprint Plan → Guardrails per discipline
- **Phase 5** implements the solution sprint-by-sprint with automated testing, PR review, and KPI tracking
- **Critic + Risk Agents** validate every phase before handoff
- **`decisions.md`** is your direct communication channel — `DECIDED` entries become hard constraints; `HIGH` + `OPEN` entries block sprint start
- **Questionnaires** are generated for missing data — answer them, then `REEVALUATE` for improved results
- **All findings cite sources** — file, line number, or document reference (Anti-Hallucination Protocol)

## How the Agentic Team Works

The system is designed to be **reliable and resumable** even for large, complex projects. Three key design principles ensure stability:

### Project Brief as File
When launching a CREATE or AUDIT command via the Command Center, you can paste your full project requirements in the **Project Brief** field. This is saved to `BusinessDocs/project-brief.md` — a file the Onboarding Agent reads from disk. The chat command stays short, preventing context overload and network timeouts.

### One Agent at a Time (Checkpoint-and-Yield)
The Orchestrator runs exactly **one agent per conversation turn**. After each agent completes, its output is saved to disk, `session-state.json` is updated, and the Orchestrator yields — prompting you to type **CONTINUE**. This prevents memory overload and makes the entire process resumable. If anything fails, just type CONTINUE to pick up where you left off.

### Fresh Conversations per Phase
At phase boundaries (after Critic + Risk validation passes), the Orchestrator instructs you to **start a new Copilot Chat conversation** and type **CONTINUE**. This resets accumulated conversation history — preventing "JS heap out of memory" crashes — while `session-state.json` preserves all progress. The Command Center pipeline view is unaffected by conversation resets.

## Documentation

For the full guide including all agents, FAQ, troubleshooting, and ground rules, see:

**[`.github/docs/README.md`](.github/docs/README.md)**

---

## Testing

All dev tooling lives inside `.github/`. Run commands from that directory:

```bash
cd .github
npm install   # first time only
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode (re-run on file changes)
npm run test:watch
```

The test suite includes **576 tests** across 21 files with **95%+ statement coverage**:
- **Unit tests** — models, sanitization, cache, schemas, audit trail, file locking, backup strategy, MCP server
- **Integration tests** — API endpoints, SSE, store caching, decisions round-trip, regression suite
- Coverage thresholds enforced at 70% (statements, branches, functions, lines)

## Code Quality

```bash
cd .github
npm run lint
```

ESLint 9 flat config enforces 7 rules: `complexity` (max 8), `no-unused-vars`, `no-var`, `prefer-const`, `eqeqeq`, `no-eval`, `no-implied-eval`. Current status: **0 errors, 0 warnings**.
