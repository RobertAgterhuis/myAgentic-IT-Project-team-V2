## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- **VS Code** with [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- **Node.js ≥ 18** — [download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** — [download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### 2. Launch the Web UI

```bash
node .github/webapp/server.js
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) in your browser. The server runs locally — no internet connection needed, no data leaves your machine.

### 3. Start Your First Project

1. Open the **Command Center** tab (selected by default).
2. Click **CREATE** to start a new software solution, or **AUDIT** to analyze existing software.
3. Enter a project name and optionally paste your full requirements in the **Project Brief** field.
4. Click **Queue Command** — a short command string is copied to your clipboard.
5. Paste the command into **Copilot Chat** in VS Code.
6. The Orchestrator agent begins the pipeline automatically.

### 4. Continue the Pipeline

After each agent completes its work:
- Type **CONTINUE** in Copilot Chat to proceed to the next agent.
- At phase boundaries, start a **new Copilot Chat conversation** and type **CONTINUE** (progress is preserved).
- The Command Center pipeline view shows your current position.

---

## The Command Center

The Command Center is the home screen of the web UI. It provides:

### Command Sidebar
A categorized list of all available commands. Click any button to fill in the command form:
- **Create New Solution** — CREATE, CREATE BUSINESS, CREATE TECH, etc.
- **Audit Existing Software** — AUDIT, AUDIT BUSINESS, AUDIT TECH, etc.
- **On-Demand** — FEATURE, REEVALUATE, SCOPE CHANGE, HOTFIX
- **Session** — CONTINUE, REFRESH ONBOARDING

### Pipeline View
A horizontal progress bar showing all phases and their status:
- **Green** = completed
- **Blue** = in progress
- **Gray** = not started

Click on any phase to see its details and which agents have completed.

### Command History
A log of all commands you've sent during this session, with timestamps and status.

---

## Questionnaires

When agents encounter missing information, they generate **questionnaires** — structured sets of questions with context about why each answer matters.

### Viewing Questionnaires
1. Click the **Questionnaires** tab.
2. The sidebar lists all questionnaires grouped by phase.
3. A badge counter shows how many questions remain unanswered.

### Answering Questions
1. Select a questionnaire from the sidebar.
2. For each question, type your answer in the text area below it.
3. Click **Save** to persist your answer.
4. The status badge updates from **OPEN** to **ANSWERED**.

### Answer Validation
- Answers are checked for **secret patterns** (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, private keys). If detected, a warning appears — you should remove credentials from your answers.
- Markdown characters are sanitized to prevent formatting injection.

### After Answering
Once you've answered the key questions, run `REEVALUATE [scope]` in Copilot Chat. The system re-runs analysis with your new answers, producing better results.

## Decisions

The **Decisions** tab is your direct communication channel with the agent team. Decisions you create here become hard constraints that all agents follow.

> **For the complete decision lifecycle, category system, deferred activation, and Sprint Gate blocking rules, see [`.github/help/decisions.md`](../.github/help/decisions.md).**  
> **For technical architecture (file layout, data flow, enforcement chain), see [`docs/decisions-architecture.md`](decisions-architecture.md).**

### Decision Types
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **OPEN** | Waiting for your answer |
| **DECIDED** | Active constraint — all agents follow this |
| **DEFERRED** | Parked for later |
| **EXPIRED** | No longer relevant |

### Priority Levels
| Priority | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Blocks sprint start if scope overlaps and status is OPEN |
| **MEDIUM** | Reported but doesn't block |
| **LOW** | Informational only |

### Creating a Decision
1. Click **+ New Decision** in the Decisions tab.
2. Fill in priority, scope, and your decision or question.
3. Click **Create** — the decision is assigned an ID and written to `decisions.md`.

### Answering an Open Question
1. Find the open question in the Decisions tab.
2. Type your answer in the answer field.
3. Click **Answer** — status changes to DECIDED if it was a question from the agents.

### Filtering
Use the search bar, priority dropdown, and status dropdown to filter decisions.

| `REFRESH ONBOARDING` | Both | Re-scan codebase, keep intake answers |

### Combination Commands
You can combine 2–3 disciplines in one session:
```
CREATE TECH UX MyProject
CREATE BUSINESS MARKETING MyProject
AUDIT TECH UX MARKETING MyProject
```
Execution order is always: BUSINESS → TECH → UX → MARKETING.

## Pipeline Progress

The pipeline view in the Command Center shows 7 phase groups:

1. **Onboarding** — Project intake and initial scanning
2. **Phase 1: Business** — Requirements & strategy (5 agents)
3. **Phase 2: Tech** — Architecture & design (6 agents)
4. **Phase 3: UX** — Experience design (6 agents)
5. **Phase 4: Marketing** — Brand & growth (3 agents)
6. **Synthesis** — Cross-team integration + final reports
7. **Phase 5: Implementation** — Sprint-by-sprint coding

Each agent within a phase shows its completion status. The critical path progresses sequentially.

## Real-Time Updates (SSE)

The web UI maintains a **Server-Sent Events** connection to the server for real-time updates:
- **Data changes** are pushed instantly (no need to refresh).
- A **connection status indicator** (green/red dot) shows the SSE connection state.
- If the server becomes unreachable, a banner appears: _"Server unreachable — retrying automatically"_.
- Reconnection is automatic with exponential backoff.

---

## MCP Integration (Cross-IDE)

The system includes an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that lets you use the Command Center tools directly from your IDE's AI assistant, without switching to the web UI.

### Supported IDEs
- **VS Code** — Works out of the box (`.vscode/mcp.json` is pre-configured)
- **Visual Studio** — Add an MCP stdio server: `node .github/webapp/mcp-server.js`
- **JetBrains IDEs** — Add an MCP stdio server: `node .github/webapp/mcp-server.js`

### What You Can Do via MCP
- Check project status and pipeline progress
- Browse and answer questionnaires
- Create, answer, and finalize decisions
- Queue commands for the orchestrator
- Read help documentation
- View the mutation audit trail

### How It Works
The MCP server runs as a **stdio process** — the IDE launches it automatically when needed. It reads and writes the same files as the web UI, so both interfaces stay in sync.

No additional setup is needed for VS Code. For other IDEs, configure an MCP server with command `node` and argument `.github/webapp/mcp-server.js`.

## Accessibility Features

The web UI is designed for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:

- **Skip-to-content link** — Press Tab on page load to skip to main content.
- **Keyboard navigation** — All tabs, buttons, and form fields are keyboard-accessible.
- **Screen reader support** — `aria-live` regions announce status changes and errors.
- **Focus management** — Focus is trapped in modal dialogs and restored on close.
- **Reduced motion** — Animations are disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.
- **Font size controls** — Small/Default/Large text options in the header.
- **Dark mode** — Toggle via the moon icon in the header.
- **High contrast** — CSS custom properties adapt to system contrast preferences.
- **Form validation** — Inline error messages with `role="alert"` for screen readers.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run this without VS Code?**
A: The web UI works in any browser. The AI agents work in VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains IDEs via MCP integration.

**Q: Does any data leave my machine?**
A: No. The server runs on `127.0.0.1` only. The MCP server uses stdio (no network). All data is stored locally in your repository as files.

**Q: What happens if VS Code crashes mid-pipeline?**
A: All progress is saved to `session-state.json`. Just reopen VS Code, start a new Copilot Chat, and type `CONTINUE`.

**Q: Can I skip phases?**
A: Yes — use partial commands like `CREATE TECH MyProject` to run only Phase 2.

**Q: How do I reset the project?**
A: Delete the session state file at `.github/docs/session/session-state.json` and start fresh.

**Q: Can I run multiple projects simultaneously?**
A: Not in the same repository. Each repository supports one active session.

**Q: How many story points per sprint?**
A: The default is 30 SP per 2-week sprint (configurable via decisions).

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Ensure Node.js ≥ 18 is installed: `node --version`
- Check port 3000 is available: `lsof -i :3000` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :3000` (Windows)
- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only — if you need a different port, set the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable.

### Web UI shows "Server unreachable"
- Verify the server is still running in your terminal.
- Check the terminal for error messages.
- The UI retries automatically — wait a few seconds.

### Copilot Chat doesn't respond to commands
- Ensure GitHub Copilot is active (check the Copilot icon in VS Code status bar).
- Start a **new** Copilot Chat conversation if the current one is too long.
- Verify the workspace includes the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.

### Tests fail after pulling updates
```bash
cd .github
npm install          # Update dev dependencies
npm test             # Re-run tests
npm run lint         # Check for lint issues
```

### "JS heap out of memory" errors
This happens when a Copilot Chat conversation accumulates too much context. Start a new conversation and type `CONTINUE` — all progress is preserved in session state.

### Questionnaires not showing up
- Verify questionnaire files exist in `BusinessDocs/` subdirectories.
- Check that the server can read the files (correct working directory).
- Refresh the page — questionnaires are loaded on tab activation.

### Decisions not saving
- Check that `.github/docs/decisions.md` exists and is writable.
- Look for error messages in the browser console (F12 → Console tab).
- The server creates backups before writing — check for `.bak` files if data seems lost.
