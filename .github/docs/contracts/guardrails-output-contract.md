# Guardrails Output Contract
> Version: 1.0 | Applies to all guardrail deliverables of all agents

---

## PURPOSE
This contract defines the structure for the **Guardrails** deliverable per discipline.
A guardrail is a TESTABLE, BINDING decision rule — NOT a vague guideline.

---

## Output File Path

`.github/docs/phases/phase-N-[discipline]-guardrails.md`

Where `N` is the phase number (1–4) and `[discipline]` is the lowercase discipline name (e.g., `phase-4-marketing-guardrails.md`).

---

## DEFINITION OF A GUARDRAIL
A guardrail:
- Formulates a **prohibition** or **obligation** in concrete terms
- Is **testable**: you can determine whether a decision or artifact violates the guardrail
- Has a **violation action**: what happens if the guardrail is breached
- Has a **scope**: for whom and when the guardrail applies
- Has a **rationale**: why this is a guardrail

**NOT valid as a guardrail:** "Ensure good code quality"  
**VALID:** "Code may not be merged to production without 80% test coverage (G-ARCH-10)"

## MANDATORY SCHEMA

### MARKDOWN STRUCTURE

```markdown
# Guardrails – [Discipline] – [Date]

## Metadata
- Agent: [name]
- Phase: [1 / 2 / 3 / 4]
- Date: [ISO 8601]
- Based on analysis: [reference]
- Mode: [CREATE | AUDIT]

## Scope Change Impact *(SCOPE_CHANGE mode only — omit in normal cycles)*
> Required as the FIRST section when `cycle_type: SCOPE_CHANGE` in session state.
### Still Valid
- [G-DISC-NNN]: [one sentence — guardrail still applicable under the new premise]
### Superseded
- [G-DISC-NNN]: [what changed that makes this guardrail no longer applicable or requiring revision]
### Net-New
- [G-DISC-NNN new]: [description of guardrail with no equivalent in the prior analysis]

## Guardrail [G-DISC-NNN]

### Title
[Short, descriptive name]

### Scope
- Applies to: [which agents / phases / artifacts]
- Time horizon: [permanent / until sprint N / review date]

### Rule
[Concrete, testable formulation. Start with a verb: "May not", "Must always", "Requires", etc.]

### Violation Action
[What happens on breach? E.g.: "Mark as GUARDRAIL_VIOLATION: G-DISC-NNN, block handoff, escalate to Orchestrator"]

### Rationale
[Why is this a guardrail? Based on which finding or risk? Reference RISK-NNN or GAP-NNN]

### Verification Method
[How do you verify whether an artifact complies? E.g.: "Automated test present in CI", "Code review checklist item", "Manual audit at every sprint review"]

## VALIDATION CRITERIA
A guardrail document is REJECTED if:
- A guardrail is not formulated as testable
- A violation action is missing
- A rationale does not reference an analysis finding
- A verification method is missing

### Cross-reference: ORC-35
**ORC-35**: If this contract's output fails validation 3 consecutive times in the same session, the Orchestrator escalates to the user with options: ACCEPT_PARTIAL, RETRY_SIMPLIFIED, or MANUAL_OVERRIDE.
