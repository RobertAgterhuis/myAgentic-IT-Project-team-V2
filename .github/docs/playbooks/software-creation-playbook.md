# New Software Solution Creation – Complete Playbook
> End-to-end creation process for new commercial software products

---

## OVERVIEW

This playbook describes the complete creation process from A to Z. It covers five phases and produces a final Solution Blueprint with Executive Summary, Solution Blueprint Heatmap, Risk Matrix, 12-month roadmap, Guardrail document, KPI targets, and Sprint Completion Reports per implemented sprint.

**The order is non-negotiable.** Strategy → Technology → Experience → Growth → Implementation.

---

## PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS & STRATEGY (2–3 weeks)

### Objective
Complete definition of the business model, product vision, requirements, strategic positioning, and financial projections for the new software product before any technical or UX design starts.

### Agents (In Order)
1. **Business Analyst** (skill: `01-business-analyst.md`)
2. **Domain Expert** (skill: `02-domain-expert.md`)
3. **Sales Strategist** (skill: `03-sales-strategist.md`)
4. **Financial Analyst** (skill: `04-financial-analyst.md`)
5. **Product Manager** (skill: `34-product-manager.md`)

### Required Input
- Project brief (product idea, target market, value proposition)
- Business documentation (financial constraints, budget, timeline)
- Domain information (industry, compliance framework, target audience)
- Optional: stakeholder interviews, market research, competitor analysis
- Optional: reference codebase or existing prototype (if available)

### Required Output (Phase 1)
```json
{
  "product_vision": {},
  "business_model_canvas": {},
  "business_rules": [],
  "risk_assessment": [],
  "kpi_targets": {},
  "gap_analysis": {
    "market": [],
    "product": [],
    "revenue": [],
    "operations": []
  },
  "priority_matrix": [],
  "icp": {},
  "go_to_market_strategy": {},
  "financial_projections": {}
}
```

### Validation
After Phase 1: **Critic Agent** + **Risk Agent** validation mandatory.
Phase 2 does NOT start without both validations APPROVED.

### Post-Phase 1: Questionnaire Agent
After Critic + Risk PASSED:
1. **Questionnaire Agent** (skill: `36-questionnaire-agent.md`) — collects all `INSUFFICIENT_DATA:` items from Phase 1 agents and generates customer-facing questionnaires in `BusinessDocs/Phase1-Business/Questionnaires/`
2. **Questionnaire Agent** — creates or updates `BusinessDocs/OfficialDocuments/product-vision.md` and `financial-model-overview.md` based on verified Phase 1 output and any answered questionnaire data

Questionnaire generation NEVER blocks Phase 2. Answers fed back via REEVALUATE or new CREATE cycle.
Non-technical stakeholders can use the Questionnaire & Decisions Manager web UI: `node .github/webapp/server.js` → http://127.0.0.1:3000
Decisions can also be created and answered from the **Decisions** tab in the web UI — changes are written directly to `.github/docs/decisions.md`.

---

## SYNTHESIS (1 week)

### Objective
Consolidation of all phase outputs into one coherent Solution Blueprint for decision-makers and implementation teams.

### Agent
**Synthesis Agent** (skill: `17-synthesis-agent.md`)

### Required Output (Final Report)
1. Executive Summary (board-level, max 2 pages)
2. Solution Blueprint Heatmap (readiness across dimensions)
3. Risk Matrix (consolidated)
4. 12-month roadmap (build milestones)
5. Combined Guardrail Document
6. KPI Target Dashboard
7. Open Items Register

---

## POST-SYNTHESIS: GITHUB INTEGRATION

After Synthesis is APPROVED, the **GitHub Integration Agent** (skill: `27-github-integration-agent.md`) publishes all sprint stories as GitHub Issues in `INITIAL_PUBLICATION` mode. This creates the project board, labels, milestones, and issues before any sprint begins.

---

## SPRINT GATE

### Definition
The Sprint Gate is the decision point between Synthesis and each sprint in Phase 5. It gates entry into implementation and recurs between sprints.

### Inputs
- Synthesis outputs (all 6 documents APPROVED)
- `.github/docs/decisions.md` (decided items since last gate)
- `.github/docs/session/reevaluate-trigger.json` (if `status: "PENDING"`)
- Sprint Completion Report from previous sprint (if not first sprint)
- Lessons learned from previous sprint (if not first sprint)

### Sprint Gate Steps
1. **Step 0 — Check Decisions + Reevaluate Triggers:** Load decisions.md for new DECIDED items; check reevaluate-trigger.json for PENDING triggers. If PENDING reevaluate found, execute REEVALUATE before proceeding.
2. **Step 1 — Present Sprint:** Present the next sprint's stories to user for `IMPLEMENT` or `BACKLOG` decision per story. Apply Definition of Ready check. Inject lessons-learned from previous sprints.

### Outputs
- Sprint activation decision: `IMPLEMENT` | `BACKLOG` per story
- Updated story statuses in session-state.json
- Lessons-learned injection into agent contexts

### Transition
On `IMPLEMENT` decision → Phase 5 activates for the selected sprint.

---

## PHASE 5: AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION (Ongoing per sprint)

### Objective
Actual implementation of the designed software product per the approved sprint stories from Phases 1–4, fully autonomous and traceable, with automated tests, guardrail validation, and Sprint Completion Reports per sprint.

### Agents (Per Sprint, In Order)
1. **Implementation Agent** (skill: `20-implementation-agent.md`) — writes code per story
2. **Test Agent** (skill: `21-test-agent.md`) — validates implementation against acceptance criteria
3. **PR/Review Agent** (skill: `22-pr-review-agent.md`) — final review, create PR, close sprint
4. ↓ **Critic Agent** (skill: `18-critic-agent.md`) — validate sprint output
5. ↓ **Risk Agent** (skill: `19-risk-agent.md`) — risk assessment per sprint
6. **KPI Agent** (skill: `29-kpi-agent.md`) — measure sprint KPIs and emit alerts
7. **Documentation Agent** (skill: `26-documentation-agent.md`) — update user/technical manuals and changelog
8. **GitHub Integration Agent** (skill: `27-github-integration-agent.md`) — update project board and close issues
9. **Retrospective Agent** (skill: `28-retrospective-agent.md`) — sprint retrospective, velocity log, lessons learned

### Required Input
- Synthesis Final Report (complete, Critic + Risk APPROVED)
- Approved sprint plans from all specialist agents
- Architecture decisions from Phase 2 (Software Architect + Senior Developer output)
- Design system from Phase 3 (UI Designer + Storybook Agent output)
- Guardrails (`.github/docs/guardrails/00–09`)
- Implementation Output Contract (`.github/docs/contracts/implementation-output-contract.md`)

**HALT:** Phase 5 NEVER starts without a fully APPROVED Synthesis Final Report and validated sprint plans (Critic + Risk PASSED per phase).

### Execution Per Sprint

```
For each sprint (SP-1, SP-2, ...):
  1. Orchestrator: activate stories per sprint plan (parallel tracks = simultaneously)
  2. Per story: Implementation Agent → Test Agent (return if REJECTED)
  3. After all stories: PR/Review Agent assembles sprint PR
  4. Critic Agent validates Sprint Completion Report
  5. Risk Agent assesses new findings
  6. On PASSED: merge PR, activate next sprint
  7. On FAILED: return to Implementation Agent per finding
```

### Parallel Tracks

Stories in the same sprint that have NO mutual dependencies (identified in the Parallel Tracks section of the sprint plans) are picked up **simultaneously** by multiple Implementation Agent instances. The PR/Review Agent assembles all story outputs into one sprint PR after all stories are APPROVED.

### Required Output (Per Sprint)
```json
{
  "sprint_id": "SP-N",
  "sprint_goal": "",
  "stories_implemented": [],
  "sprint_completion_report": {},
  "pr_url": "",
  "kpi_measurement": {},
  "new_critical_findings": [],
  "blockers_open": [],
  "critic_status": "PASSED | FAILED",
  "risk_status": "PASSED | FAILED"
}
```

### Validation Per Sprint
After each sprint: **Critic Agent** + **Risk Agent** validation mandatory.
Next sprint does NOT start without both validations APPROVED.

---

## ON-DEMAND COMMANDS

These commands can be triggered at any time, independent of the running sprint cycle:

### REEVALUATE [scope]
Re-analyzes one or more phases after requirements or context has changed — direction stays the same, design decisions are updated via delta.

| Scope | What is re-analyzed |
|-------|---------------------|
| `BUSINESS` | Phase 1 only |
| `TECH` | Phase 2 only |
| `UX` | Phase 3 only |
| `MARKETING` | Phase 4 only |
| `ALL` | All four phases |
| `DELTA-ONLY` | Valid modifier: detect what changed, no full re-analysis |

Agent: `23-reevaluate-agent.md` → Critic + Risk → Re-evaluation Report → Orchestrator (Sprint Gate impact)

### SCOPE CHANGE [DIMENSION]: [description]
Changes the fundamental premise on which the solution design was built — not a delta, but a direction change.

Use when: business model pivot, core architecture change, target audience shift — situations where parts of the existing design become actively *wrong*.

| Dimension | Affected design |
|-----------|------------------|
| `BUSINESS` | Phase 1 agents |
| `TECH` | Phase 2 agents |
| `UX` | Phase 3 agents |
| `MARKETING` | Phase 4 agents |
| `ALL` | All phases |

Agent: `37-scope-change-agent.md` → Backlog Hold → Invalidation marking → Re-analysis → Critic + Risk → Sprint Gate Reconciliation → Master Synthesis update
Output: `.github/docs/synthesis/scope-change-[N].md` + updated sprint statuses

### FEATURE [name]: [description]
Runs the complete Phase 1–4 + Synthesis + Sprint Plan cycle for a single new feature in an isolated workspace.

Output: `Workitems/[FEATURENAME]/` — own sprint IDs, own Sprint Gate, no impact on main backlog without Orchestrator approval.
Agent: `24-feature-agent.md`

### HOTFIX [description]
Emergency protocol for critical production issues. Bypasses Sprint Gate.

Agent pipeline: Implementation → Test (abbreviated) → PR/Review (secret scan mandatory) → merge → KPI → Documentation → GitHub Integration → Retrospective
Sprint ID: `HOTFIX-[N]` | Mandatory: LESSON_CANDIDATE + DECIDED item if structural constraint results.

### REFRESH ONBOARDING
Re-runs steps 3+4 of the Onboarding Agent (project scan + tooling check) without re-asking intake questions.
Useful after significant changes when a full REEVALUATE is premature.

## CORE PRINCIPLE

> **Building without strategic validation leads to features without market value.**

The order:
**Strategy → Technology → Experience → Growth → Implementation**

is deliberate and immutable.
